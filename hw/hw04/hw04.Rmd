### Instructions 
* Solutions will be released on Tuesday, July 20
* This semester, homework assignments are for practice only and will not be turned in for marks.

Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration!

**[12 points] Part 1: Simulating birth defect data and sampling from an infinitely large population** 

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in every
33 infants is born with a birth defect in the United States each year.

1) [3 points] Define a random variable for "birth defect". Write down the probability model for the random variable. Round each percentage to two decimal places (e.g., 0.43224 would be rounded to 43.22%). Is the sample space discrete or continuous?


[TODO: Replace the text with your list of proportions and your explanation.]

You might want to use the table template below to write out your probability 
model. If not, then delete it. *Knit now* to see how this table is rendered in your PDF.

| Tables   |      Are     |  Cool |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| yadi     | type stuff   | X     |
| yadi     | more stuff   | Y     |
| yada     | etc          | Z     |

\newpage

2) [2 points] Simulate data that equals 0 if there is no birth defect and equals
1 if there is a birth defect. Simulate this data for 200 births at a local 
hospital. Be sure to use the risk of birth defect from part a). Assign your 
simulated output the name `sim_01`. Print your simulated births 
to the screen.

Before you run your simulation, we will "set the seed". We all will set the seed
to 100. This means that everyone's simulation will yield the exact same dataset.

```{r set-seed}
set.seed(100) 
# execute this line before you write your simulation code.
# only execute the set.seed() function one time. 
```

```{r simulate-200-births}
sim_01 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
sim_01
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p2.R")
```

Notice that `sim_01` is not a data frame, rather it is a vector of numbers. The 
following code stores `sim_01` as a data frame and changes its variable name. 
Run this code and view `sim_01` in the Viewer pane.


## STOP! Remove eval = F from this code chunk before moving on.
```{r, message=F, warning=F, eval = F}
library(dplyr)
sim_01 <- as.data.frame(sim_01) # watch what happens to sim_01 in your environment
names(sim_01) # prints the variable names in the sim_01 data frame
sim_01 <- sim_01 %>% rename(birth_defect = sim_01)
```

\newpage

3) [2 points] Write code to determine the number of birth defects that occurred in your simulation, and the corresponding proportion with birth defects. Assign your 
output the name `output_01`. Print `output_01` to the screen. Hint: Use `dplyr` functions to do this.

```{r, problem-3}

output_01 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
output_01
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p3.R")
```

\newpage

4) [2 marks] Re-run your simulation four more times and assign the output to a unique name each time. Print to the screen the number and proportion after each run. (Basically, "recycle" the code above four times)

```{r, problem-4}
sim_02 <- 'YOUR ANSWER HERE'
output_02 <- 'YOUR ANSWER HERE'
output_02
sim_03 <- 'YOUR ANSWER HERE'
output_03 <- 'YOUR ANSWER HERE'
output_03
sim_04 <- 'YOUR ANSWER HERE'
output_04 <- 'YOUR ANSWER HERE'
output_04
sim_05 <- 'YOUR ANSWER HERE'
output_05 <- 'YOUR ANSWER HERE'
output_05

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p4.R")
```

\newpage

5) [1 mark] Assign the vector p5 to the simulated proportions from each of your five simulations in *increasing* order.

```{r, problem-5}
p5 <- c('YOUR ANSWER HERE')
p5

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p5.R")
```

\newpage

6) [1 mark] Did you get close to the true value? Explain why there is variation in the proportions across the simulations.

\newpage

7) [1 mark] Suppose that rather than simulating 5 samples of size 200, we simulated 5 samples of size 1000. In 1-2 sentences, how would you expect the group of proportion estimates from part e) to be different? Comment both on the accuracy of these values at predicting the true value, and their variance. If you're not sure, you can re-run your simulation with a larger sample size and see how the results change to deduct the difference.

**[8 points] Part 2: Probability of HIV and Hepatitis C**

Approximately 1.1 million Americans have HIV and 3.5 million Americans have 
Hepatitis C (HCV). The number of individuals with coinfection (e.g. both HIV 
and HCV) is 300,000. Among individuals with HIV, approximately 25% have 
Hepatitis C. The total US population was approximately 321 million at the time 
of these statistics.

* https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0504-hepc-mortality.html
* https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/populations/hiv.htm

\newpage

8) [2 points] Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen American will have HIV.Calculate the probability that a randomly chosen American will have HCV. Convert to percentages and round to two decimal places. Save these values as the vector p2a with the proportion for HIV first then HCV. Don't inclue the % in your answer.

```{r, problem-2a}
p8 <- c('YOUR ANSWER HERE')
p8

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p8.R")
```

\newpage

9) [2 points] Without using the number of co-infections provided in the question (that is: do not use the value 300,000), calculate the probability that someone will have both HIV and HCV. Convert to a percentage rounded to two decimal places and save to object p2b. Don't include the percent in your answer.

```{r, problem-9}
p9 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p9.R")
```

\newpage

10) [2 points] Are HIV and HCV infections independent? Show work to support your 
answer. Uncomment your selection.

```{r, problem-10}
#p10 <- 'independent'
#p10 <- 'not independent'

```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p10.R")
```

\newpage

11) [2 points] In general, does P(A|B) equal P(B|A)? Calculate P(HIV | HCV) and
report whether or not it is equal to P(HCV | HIV).

**[9 points] part 3: Screening for lung cancer**

Background reading: Read pages 258-261 (and optionally 261-264) of Baldi & 
Moore, Edition 4. (For earlier editions, look for the section on diagnostic 
testing in medicine or on screening which covers sensitivity, specificity, 
negative predictive value, and positive predictive value). 

Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States.
Researchers examined the idea of testing all Medicare-enrolled heavy smokers for
lung cancer with a computed tomography (CT) scan every year. In this population, 
the lifetime chance of developing lung cancer is high. In any given year, 
approximately 3% of heavy smokers develop lung cancer. The CT scan positively
identifies lung cancer 89% of the time, and it gives negative results for 93% 
of individuals who do not have lung cancer.

\newpage

12) [3 points] Use probability notation to express the three proabilities cited. Make sure to define each event using a capital letter (or two). Provide the terminology for the 89% and 93% values based on your readings.

\newpage



13) [3 points] What percent of CT scans in this target population would be positive? Answer this question by making either a probability tree or using absolute frequencies. Show your work.

<Note: If you are writing your solutions in R markdown you may want to upload an image of a hand-drawn tree diagram (this is optional). If so use the following code, or delete if not using. Be sure to remove the option "eval = F" if using this code or it won't run when you knit the file!:>

```{r, echo=F, out.width="80%", eval=F}
library(knitr)
#include_graphics("src/your-scans-name.jpg")
# Once you replace the above line with your file's name (after uploading the file
# to datahub's Image sub-directory) you can execute the line of code and 
# verify that the tree diagram is printed below the code chunk.

```

\newpage

14) [1 point] We will now solve for the probability that a Medicare-enrolled heavy smoker who gets a positive scan actually has lung cancer. Write out the probability statement for this amount.

15) [1 point] Calculate the probability value from question 14 based on your previous work from question 13. Store the answer as a percentage rounded to one decimal place in the object p15.

```{r}
p15 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p15.R")
```


16) [1 point] What term from your reading does this value represent? 
Store the answer in object p16.

```{r}
p16 <- NULL # YOUR ANSWER HERE
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p16.R")
```
