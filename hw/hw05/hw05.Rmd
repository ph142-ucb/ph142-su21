### Instructions 
* Solutions will be released on Friday, July 23
* This semester, homework assignments are for practice only and will not be turned in for marks.

Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration! **You must knit correctly before submitting.**

- To avoid code running off the page, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the file. If it doesn't look right, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

**[7 points] Part 1: Pregnancy Length Probabilities** 

An average pregnancy for humans lasts 266 days, with a standard deviation of 
16 days. Assume that human pregnancies are Normally distributed. 

1. [3 marks] Approximately what proportion of births are expected to occur on or before 298 days? To aid your answer, hand-draw (or use any software) to sketch a Normal curve, and shade in the area under the Normal density curve the question represents. Add dashed lines at the mean +/- 1SD, 2SD and 3SD. Then calculate the proportion asked about in the first sentence. You shouldn't need to use R to perform any calculations for this question. Report the proportion to one decimal place.

(Use the code chunk below to include an image file of your drawing. To do so you need to delete the hashtag, upload the image to Datahub into the `src` directory and replace the file name with your file name. JPG or PNG will both work.)

```{r, out.width="50%"}
#knitr::include_graphics("src/Your-file-name.JPG")
```

2. [1 mark] Check your answer from part a) using R code. Create a vector called `p2` that stores 2 values: your answer from part a and the absolute difference between your answer from a and the exact probability that you calculated with code.

```{r}
p2 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p2
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p2.R")
```

\newpage


3. [3 marks] What is the range, in days, that the middle 50% of pregnancies last? To aid your answer, hand-draw (or use any software) to sketch a Normal curve, and shade in the area that the middle represents. Then, use R to calculate the requested range. Round the lower and upper bound of the range each to two decimal places.

(Use the code chunk below to include an image file of your drawing. To do so you need to delete the hashtag, upload the image to Datahub into the `src` directory and replace the file name with your file name. JPG or PNG will both work.)\

```{r}
#knitr::include_graphics("src/Your-file-name.JPG")
```

```{r, out.width="50%"}
#Your code here

**[7 points] Part 2: Assessing Normality and Interpreting QQ Plots** 

The number of trees for nine plots of land, each of 0.1 hectare, have been recorded. They are: 18, 4, 22, 15, 18, 19, 22, 12, 12. Are these data Normally distributed?


\newpage


4. [3 marks] Make a Normal quantile plot for these data using R. Remember, to make a ggplot of these data, you need to first input the data as a vector and then convert that vector to a data frame. Example code has been provided to you to get you started. After making the plot, assess whether the data appear to approximately follow a Normal distribution.

```{r ggplot_qqplot,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# example code

counts <- c(1, 2, 3)
tree_data <- data.frame(counts)
# your code for ggplot here 

```

**[12 points] Part 3: Conducting a general anxiety disorder study** 

Suppose that a new treatment for COVID-19 has undergone 
safety and efficacy trials and based on these data 45% of patients with 
COVID-19 are expected to benefit from the new treatment. You are
conducting a follow-up study and so far have enrolled 14 participants with 
COVID-19 into your study. These patients do not know each other
and represent individuals who responded to a mailed flyer. 


\newpage


5. [2 marks] Let $X$ represent the number of patients that you have enrolled who benefit from the treatment. Does $X$ meet the assumptions of a Binomial distribution? Thoroughly explain why or why not.

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

\newpage


6. [1 mark] Using one of the distributions learned in class that $X$ meets the assumptions of, calculate by hand the probability that exactly 7 participants will benefit.
Show your work.

7. [1 mark] Confirm your previous calculation using an R function. Store your answer to p7.

```{r}
p7<- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p7
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p7.R")
```

\newpage


8. [2 marks] Calculate by hand the probability that 12 or more participants will benefit. 
Show your work.

\newpage

9. [1 mark] Confirm your previous calculation using code that depends on `pbinom()`. Store your answer to p9.

```{r}
p9 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p9
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p9.R")
```


\newpage


10. [1 mark] Re-confirm your previous calculation, this time using code that depends on `dbinom()`. Store your answer to p10.

```{r}
p10 <- NULL # YOUR CODE HERE
p10
```

```{r}
. = ottr::check("tests/p10.R")
```

\newpage


11. [4 marks] Calculate the number of patients you would expect to benefit 
from the treatment and the standard deviation. Write a sentence
to interpret the meaning of the mean. If the mean is not a whole number, what 
whole number is most probable?

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._

\newpage


12. [1 mark] Should you apply a Normal approximation to these data using the $\mu$ and $\sigma$
you calculated in the last question? Why or why not?
