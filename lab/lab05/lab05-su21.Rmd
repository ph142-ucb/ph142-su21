### Instructions 
* Due date: Friday, July 23 at 10:00pm PST with 2 hour grace period.
* Late penalty: 50% late penalty if submitted within 24 hours of due date, no 
marks for assignments submitted thereafter.
* This assignment is graded on **correct completion**, all or nothing. You must pass all public tests and submit the assignment for credit.
* Submission process: Follow the submission instructions on the final page. Make sure you do not remove any `\newpage` tags or rename this file, as this will break the submission. 

Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration! **You must knit correctly before submitting.**

- If your code runs off the page of the knitted PDF then you will LOSE POINTS! To
avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the 
file (you can easily view it on Gradescope via the provided link after submitting). 
If it doesn't look right, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using
the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

Part 1 of this lab focuses on calculating probability of independent events.

### Section I: Breakout Problems on Independence

## Blood Type

**From Baldi and Moore (3E question 10.28, 4E question 10.30)**
  All human blood can be one of the following types: O, A, B, or AB,
but the distribution of blood types varies a bit among different populations of people.  
Here are the distributions of blood types for a randomly chosen person in China and in the United States:
  
Check out the following table:
  
  |       |  $O$ |  $A$ |  $B$ |  $AB$ | 
  |-------|------|------|------|-------|
  |China  |  0.35|  0.27|  0.26|   0.12| 
  |U.S.   |  0.45|  0.40|  0.11|   0.04|   
  
  
  
Choose an American person and a Chinese person at random, independently of each other.


**1. [1 point]	What is the probability that both have type O blood?**

**3. [1 point] From Baldi and Moore (3E question 10.29, 4E not present)**
  
  _Universal blood donors._  
People with type O-negative blood are universal donors.  
That is, any patient can receive a transfusion of type O-negative blood.  
Only 7.2 % of the American population have O-negative blood.  
If 10 people appear at random to give blood, what is the probability that at least 1 of them is a universal donor?

\newpage

**From Baldi and Moore (3E question 10.46, 4E not present)**
  
  _Mendelian inheritance._ 

Some traits of plants and animals depend on inheritance of a single gene.  
This is called _Mendelian inheritance_, after Gregor Mendel (1822-1884).
Each of us has an ABO blood type, which describes whether two characteristics called A and B are present.  
Every human being has two blood type alleles (gene forms), one inherited from our mother and one from our father.  
Each of these alleles can be A, B, or O.  Which two we inherit determines our blood type.  
Here is a table that shows what our blood type is for each combination of two alleles.

  |Alleles inherited   | 	Blood type|
  |--------------------|------------|
  |	A and A            |           A|
  |	A and B	           |			    AB|
  |	A and O	           |			     A|
  |	B and B	           |           B|
  |	B and O	           |		    	 B|
  |	O and O	           |     			 O|
  
  We inherit each of a parent’s two alleles with probability .50,
and we inherit independently from our mother and our father.


Punnett squares are used in genetics courses to organize this type of information.
The alleles for one parent label the rows and for the other parent label the columns.


**4. [1 point] Rachel and Jonathan both have alleles A and B. What blood types can their children have?**

\newpage

**6. [1 point] If Jasmine and Tyrone have three children, what is the probability that all three have blood type O?	What is the probability that the first child has blood type O and the next two do not?**
  
The next calculations assume that they do not have any twins or triplets, 
so that each child is independent.

what is the probability that all three have blood type O?

## The Flu

**7. [2 points] From Baldi and Moore (2E question 10.20 to 10.23)**
  
  The November 2009 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index survey asked a random sample of 28,606 American adults whether they had the flu on the day before the interview.  Here are the results by age group:
  |age group |		flu| 		no flu|	  total|
  |----------|-------|----------|--------|
  | 18 to 29 |		 88|	   2,486|   2,574|
  |	30 to 44 |		132|	   5,162|   5,294|
  |	45 to 64 |		276|		11,733|  12,009|
  |	65+      |	  122|	   8,607|	  8,729|
  |total     |	  618|		27,988|  28,606|
  
  The events "adult is in a specified age group" and "adult has the flu" are called **independent** if the probability of flu does not vary across the age groups.
  

The conditional probabilities of flu among those age 65 and older is _________ and flu among those 18 to 29 years old is _________. 

**Calculate and compare the probability of flu among those age 65 and older and the probability of flu among those 18 to 29 years old.**

_Type your answer here, replacing this text._


This shows that the events "age group" and "adult has the flu" are **not** independent.

Another way to check for independence is to see if the overall probability of flu differs from the age-group stratum specific probabilities of flu. Do this, too.

## Testing for HIV 

**From Baldi and Moore (question 10.14)**
  
  
  Enzyme immunoassay tests are used to screen blood specimens for the
presence of antibodies to HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Antibodies indicate the presence of the virus. The test is quite accurate but is not always correct. Here are approximate
probabilities of positive and negative test results when the blood tested does and does not
actually contain antibodies to HIV. [Hint: these are conditional probabilities, given HIV status.]

* P( test positive + | antibodies present ) = 0.9985
* P( test positive + | antibodies absent ) = 0.0060
* P( test negative – | antibodies present ) = 0.0015
* P( test negative – | antibodies absent ) = 0.9940

Suppose that 1% of a large population carries antibodies to HIV in its blood.

**8. [1 point] Draw a tree diagram representing the HIV status of a person from this population (outcomes: antibodies present or absent) and the blood test result (outcomes: test positive or test negative).**


(Use the code chunk below to include an image file of your drawing. To do so you need to delete the hashtag, upload the image to Datahub into the `src` directory and replace the file name with your file name. JPG or PNG will both work.)

```{r}
#Take off the '#' in the following code and replace the code with you file name 
#knitr::include_graphics("src/Your-file-name.JPG")

### Submission

For assignments in this class, you'll be submitting using the **Terminal** tab in the pane below. In order for the submission to work properly, make sure that:

1. Any image files you add that are needed to knit the file are in the `src` folder and file paths are specified accordingly. 
2. You **have not changed the file name** of the assignment.
3. The file knits properly.

Once you have checked these items, you can proceed to submit your assignment.

1. Click on the **Terminal** tab in the pane below.
2. Copy-paste the following line of code into the terminal and press enter.

cd; cd ph142-su21/lab/lab05; python3 turn_in.py

3. Follow the prompts to enter your Gradescope username and password. When entering your password, you won't see anything come up on the screen--don't worry! This is just for security purposes--just keep typing and hit enter.
4. If the submission is successful, you should see "Submission successful!" appear as output.
5. If the submission fails, try to diagnose the issue using the error messages--if you have problems, post on Piazza. 

The late policy will be strictly enforced, **no matter the reason**, including submission issues, so be sure to submit early enough to have time to diagnose issues if problems arise.
