### Instructions 
* Due date: Tuesday, March 16 at 10:00pm PST with 2 hour grace period.
* Late penalty: 50% late penalty if submitted within 24 hours of due date, no marks for assignments submitted thereafter.
Remember: This homework does not involve autograder checking! The submission process is different than usual
**Don't delete or add any `\newpage` tags.**
* Submission process: Once finished, export your PDF and upload directly to Gradescope. Make sure to not remove or add any `\newpage` tags. 

Helpful hints:

- Every function you need to use was taught during lecture! So you may need to 
revisit the lecture code to help you along by opening the relevant files on Datahub. 
Alternatively, you may wish to view the code in the condensed PDFs posted 
on the course website. Good luck!

- Knit your file early and often to minimize knitting errors! If you copy and 
paste code for the slides, you are bound to get an error that is hard to 
diagnose. Typing out the code is the way to smooth knitting! We recommend 
knitting your file each time after you write a few sentences/add a new code 
chunk, so you can detect the source of knitting errors more easily. This will 
save you and the GSIs from frustration! You must knit correctly before submitting.*

- If your code runs off the page of the knitted PDF then you will LOSE POINTS! To
avoid this, have a look at your knitted PDF and ensure all the code fits in the 
file (you can easily view it on Gradescope via the provided link after submitting). 
If it doesn't look right, go back to your .Rmd file and add spaces (new lines) using 
the return or enter key so that the code runs onto the next line.

- Useful mathematical notation in markdown:

$$\mu$$

$$\sigma$$

## Overview: 

In today's lab you will read and watch articles from the internet about differences in p values and confidence intervals. You will also review information about p-hacking and data dredging to bring you up-to-speed on some of the language used to talk about bad scientific practice around the misuse of p-values.

### Section 1:

To do: 

- Watch this 11-min Youtube video on P-hacking: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx0fAjNHb1M

(Captioned video will be linked on on Lab07 thread on Piazza when available)

- Read this wikipedia article on data dredging: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging

- Read this Vox article about the Cornell food researcher: https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/9/19/17879102/brian-wansink-cornell-food-brand-lab-retractions-jama

- Read this two-page ASA brief on statistical significance and p-values: https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/P-ValueStatement.pdf
