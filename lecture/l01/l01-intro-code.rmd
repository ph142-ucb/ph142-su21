### Today's Goals

Welcome and orientation to the class - answer questions

My goals for our time together

Talk about the framework we use in the class (PPDAC)

Introduce some data visualizations using R 

## PPDAC Example 1: A smoking behaviour study

### PPDAC Example
Problem: Suppose we wish to study the smoking behavior of California residents aged
14-20 years. 

In particular, we are interested in the *prevalence* of current smoking by
gender.

What type of problem is this?

### PPDAC Example
Plan: We need to first choose a time period, because we know that smoking behavior 
has changed immensely over time. It is unfeasible to gather these data for all residents
in California who are 14-20 years old. 

Instead we conduct a *random sample* of size $n$ persons.
We collect their: age, gender, and smoking status.

Note that we need to decide how large $n$ should be, and how to obtain the random sample.
The latter question is, in particular, very important if we want to ensure that our sample is 
representative of the population of interest. Time and money also constrain how the sample
will be collected.

### PPDAC Example
Data: Suppose that a random sample of 200 persons aged 14-20 was selected, yielding these data:

|Gender                | Number of smokers | Number of non-smokers | Total |
|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------|
| Teen girls and women | 32 | 66 | 98  |
| Teen boys and men    | 27 | 75 | 102 |
| Total                | 59 | 141| 200 |

### PPDAC Example
Analysis: The proportion of women in the sample who smoke is 32/98 = 33%.
The proportion of men in the sample who smoke is 27/102 = 26%.

We would also like some idea as to how close this estimate is likely to be from the
actual proportion in the population. 

If we selected a second random sample of the same size, we would likely estimate different proportions for men and women. We 
will learn how to estimate the precision of these estimates.

### PPDAC Example
Conclusion: 33% of girls and women aged 14-20 and 26% of boys and men of the same
age group are current smokers in California in 2018 (plus a measure of uncertainty).



```{r lib-load, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
##this code chunk adds in the packages I use later in the file
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(glue)
```

```{r choose-your-state, echo=FALSE}
my_state <- "California"
```

## Example 2: Life expectancy for non-Hispanic black and white men and women in `r my_state` between 1969-2013

### Introduction 

Life expectancy is one of the core measures used in public health to comment on 
the well-being of groups of people. Differences in life expectancy by race/ethnicity,
for individuals living in the same region can reflect underlying inequalities in
policies, access to care, food environments, structural and systemic racism, among
other potential causes.

### Research objective (Problem)

The purpose of this short report is to visualize life expectancy among black and 
white men and women in `r my_state` between 1969 and 2013. 

We are interested in whether there are differences by group and whether these differences 
have changed over time.

What type of problem is this?

### Plan

Death certificates in the United States include race/ethnicity, age at death, 
and date of death and capture all deaths of US residents. These data are aggregated by the 
[CDC's National Cancer Institute](https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/) into the 
SEER*Stat software. Previously, Riddell et al.^1^, analyzed these data to 
compute estimated trends in life expectancy for non-Hispanic black and white men 
and women, for 40 US states between 1969 and 2013. States without enough data were
excluded from these analyses.

To carry out this short report, we will use data from Riddell et al. to 
visualize trends in life expectancy as part of an exploratory data analysis. In 
particular, we will plot time trends for black and white men and women in 
`r my_state`.

### Data

Here are the first few rows of these data for `r my_state`:
```{r import-and-filter-data, echo=F, message=F }
le_data <- read_csv("Life-expectancy-by-state-long.csv")

my_state_data <- le_data %>% 
  filter(state == my_state) %>%
  mutate(gender = case_when(sex == "Female" ~ "Women",
                            sex == "Male" ~ "Men")) %>%
  select(-sex)
```
![](ca_le.png)

### Analysis

```{r first-look-time-plots, echo=F, fig.width=12}
ggplot(data = my_state_data, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + 
  geom_line(aes(col = race)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ gender) +
  labs(y = "Life expectancy (years)",
       title = glue("Trends in life expectancy for black and white men and women in {my_state}")
  ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Analysis

```{r reshape-and-compute-LE-difference, echo=F, fig.width=12}
my_state_data_wide <- my_state_data %>% 
  spread(key = race, value = LE) %>%
  mutate(le_difference = white - black)

ggplot(my_state_data_wide, aes(x = year, y = le_difference)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~ gender) +
  labs(y = "Difference in life expectancy (years)",
       title = glue("Difference in life expectancy between black and white men and women in {my_state}")
       ) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Conclusion

The difference in life expectancy in 1969 between non-Hispanic blacks and whites was `r my_state_data_wide %>% filter(year == 1969, gender == "Men") %>% select(le_difference) %>% round(1)` years for men and `r my_state_data_wide %>% filter(year == 1969, gender == "Women") %>% select(le_difference) %>% round(1)` for women in `r my_state`. 

By 2013, the difference was `r my_state_data_wide %>% filter(year == 2013, gender == "Men") %>% select(le_difference) %>% round(1)` years for men and `r my_state_data_wide %>% filter(year == 2013, gender == "Women") %>% select(le_difference) %>% round(1)` for women in `r my_state`.

## Visualizations for categorical data

### Example: infectious disease data

- Task: Make a bar chart of the percent of cases on infectious disease for each 
category of disease.
- First, read and view the infectious disease data from Baldi and Moore:

```{r make-bar-chart}
id_data <- read_csv("Ch01_ID-data.csv")
```

### Example: infectious disease data
```{r show-id}
id_data
```

### Example: infectious disease data
- Note the variables `number_cases` and `percent_cases`
- What do you want the bar chart to display? What is the x and y variables for 
a bar chart?


## Introducing ggplot

### First step to building a `ggplot()`: set up the canvas

- The first line of code below pulls in the ggplot package
- The second line of code below specifies the `data` set and what goes on the `x` and `y` axes

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9.5, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(id_data, aes(x = disease, y = percent_cases)) 
```

### Next choose a function

- We will use a `geom_` function to create our chart


`ggplot()`'s `geom_bar()` makes a bar chart


### Syntax for bar charts 

ggplot(id_data, aes(x = disease, y = percent_cases)) + 

  geom_bar(stat = "identity") 
  
 stat = "identity" tells geom_bar that we supplied a y variable that is exactly what we want to plot. 
 
 We do not need geom_bar() to calculate the number or percent for us.
 
### `ggplot()`'s `geom_bar()` makes a bar chart

```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9.5, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(id_data, aes(x = disease, y = percent_cases)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```

### some additions to ggplot for style


```{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9.5, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(id_data, aes(x = disease, y = percent_cases)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
   labs(y = "Percent", x = "") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) 
```

 base_size controls the font size on these plots
 
 theme_minimal affects the "look" of the plot it removes the grey background and adds grey gridlines



### `fct_reorder` reorders `disease` according to value of `percent_cases`

```{r bar-ordered, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9.5}
id_data <- id_data %>% 
  mutate(disease_ordered = fct_reorder(disease, percent_cases, .desc = T))
```

### Re-ordered plot
```{r ordered, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 9.5, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(id_data, aes(x = disease_ordered, y = percent_cases)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  labs(y = "Percent", x = "") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### Use `aes(fill = type)` to link the bar's fill to the disease type

  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = type)) +

   theme(legend.position = "top")

### Use `aes(fill = type)` to link the bar's fill to the disease type
```{r bar-coloured, echo=FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 9.5}
ggplot(id_data, aes(x = disease_ordered, y = percent_cases)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = type)) +
  labs(y = "Percent", x = "") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(legend.position = "top")
```

## Visualizing quantitative variables

### Visualize quantitative variables using histograms 

- Histograms look a lot like bar charts, except that the bars touch because the 
underlying scale is continuous and the order of the bars matters
- In order to make a histogram, the underlying data needs to be **binned** into 
categories and the number or percent of data in each category becomes the height 
of each bar. 
- the **bins** devide the entire range of data into a series of intervals and counts
the number of observations in each interval
- the intervals must be consecutive and non-overlapping and are almost always chosen to be of equal size

### Example:  opioid state prescription rates

- The textbook gives an example using data from 2012.
- In the data folder, there is updated data from 2018. It came from the paper:
“Opioid Prescribing Rates by Congressional Districts, United States, 2016”, by 
Rolheiser et al. [link](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.2018.304532)

### Example:  opioid state prescription rates
Problem:  To determine the extent to which opioid prescribing rates vary across US congressional districts.

Plan: In an observational cross-sectional framework using secondary data, they constructed 2016 congressional district–level opioid prescribing rate estimates using a population-weighted methodology.

Data:  In the data structure we have State as the unit of analysis, and measured perscription rates as the variable of interest


### Example:  opioid state prescription rates

```{r read-opi-data}
opi_data <- read.csv("Ch01_opioid-data.csv")
head(opi_data)
```

- `Mean` provides the mean prescribing rate per 100 individuals. Thus, a mean
of 121.31 implies that in Alabama, there were 121.31 opioid prescriptions per 100 
persons, an average across the 7 congressional districts.

### Histogram of opioid prescription rates

- Task: Make a histogram of the average prescribing rates across US states
- What is the x variable? What is the y variable? 
- What `geom` should be used?

### Histogram of opioid prescription rates - default is 30 bins
ggplot(data = opi_data, aes(x = Mean)) + 

  geom_histogram(col = "white") +

  labs(x = "Mean opioid prescription rate (per 100 individuals)", 

       y = "Number of states") +

  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
  
### Histogram of opioid prescription rates
```{r hist-binwidth-no-width-specified, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = opi_data, aes(x = Mean)) + 
  geom_histogram(col = "white") +
  labs(x = "Mean opioid prescription rate (per 100 individuals)", 
       y = "Number of states") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### same graph, change the bins `geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)`
ggplot(data = opi_data, aes(x = Mean)) + 

  geom_histogram(col = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  
  labs(x = "Mean opioid prescription rate (per 100 individuals)", 
  
       y = "Number of states") +
  
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

### same graph, change the bins `geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)`
```{r hist-binwidth-5, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = opi_data, aes(x = Mean)) + 
  geom_histogram(col = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  labs(x = "Mean opioid prescription rate (per 100 individuals)", 
       y = "Number of states") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

### change the bins again `geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)`
ggplot(data = opi_data, aes(x = Mean)) + 
  
  geom_histogram(col = "white", binwidth = 10) +
  
  labs(x = "Mean opioid prescription rate (per 100 individuals)", 
  
       y = "Number of states") +
  
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)

### change the bins again `geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)`
```{r hist-binwidth-10, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = opi_data, aes(x = Mean)) + 
  geom_histogram(col = "white", binwidth = 10) +
  labs(x = "Mean opioid prescription rate (per 100 individuals)", 
       y = "Number of states") +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15)
```

## Describing your distribution - what are we looking for?

### Shape, Center, Spread
- When we examine histograms, we can make comments on a distribution's:
    - **Shape**: Is the distribution **symmetric** or **skewed** to the left or right?
    - **Center**: Does the histogram have one peak (unimodal), or two (bimodal) or more?
    - **Spread**: How spread out are the values? What is the range of the data?
    - **Outliers**: Do any of the measurements fall outside of the range of most of the data points?
   
### Is this skewed left or skewed right? 
```{r twitter-not-normal, echo=F, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Ch01_Not-normal.png")
```

### Center - one hump or two?

```{r modal, echo=F, out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("unibi.png")
```

### Outlier

```{r outs, echo=F, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("outlier.png")
```

## Time plots

### Visualize quantitative variables over time using time plots

- **Time plots** are a specific subset of line plots where the x variable is time. 
- Unlike the previous plots, the time plot shows a relationship between two 
variables: 
    i) a quantitative variable 
    ii) time 
- Often times, these plots can be used to look for cycles (e.g., seasonal 
patterns that recur each year) or trends (e.g., overall increases or decreases 
seen over time).


### Life expectancy for White men in California

Make a scatter plot of the life expectancy for White men in California
over time.

Since the dataset contains 39 states across two genders and two races, first use
a function to subset the data to contain only White men in California.

Which function from last lecture do we need?

* `mutate()`, `select()`, `filter()`, `rename()`, or `arrange()`?

### `dplyr`'s `filter()` to select a subset of rows

```{r wh-cali-dataset, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
le_data <- read_csv("Life-expectancy-by-state-long.csv")
```

```{r}
wm_cali <- le_data %>% filter(state == "California", 
                              sex == "Male", 
                              race == "white")

#this is equivalent:
wm_cali <- le_data %>% filter(state == "California" & sex == "Male" & race == "white")
```

### Here we use `geom_point` to make a graph with dots
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + 

  geom_point() +
  
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in white men in California, 1969-2013",
  
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       
       x = "Year", 
       
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")

### Here we use `geom_point` to make a graph with dots
```{r ggplot-change-titles, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in white men in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### `geom_line()` to make a line plot
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + 

  geom_line(col = "blue") +
  
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in white males in California, 1969-2013",
  
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       
       x = "Year", 
       
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")

### `geom_line()` to make a line plot
```{r ggplot-geom_line, out.width = "60%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = wm_cali, aes(x = year, y = LE)) + geom_line(col = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Life expectancy in white males in California, 1969-2013",
       y = "Life expectancy", 
       x = "Year", 
       caption = "Data from Riddell et al. (2018)")
```

### R Recap: Code we used today
1. 'ggplot' to set up a canvas for graphics
2. `geom_bar(stat = "identity")` to make a bar chart when you specify the y variable
3. `geom_histogram()` to make a histogram for which ggplot needs to calculate the count
4. `fct_reorder(var1, var2)` to reorder a categorical variable (`var1`) by a numeric variable (`var2`)
    - from the `forcats` package
5. `geom_point()` to make a plot with dots
6. `geom_line()` to make a plot with lines
